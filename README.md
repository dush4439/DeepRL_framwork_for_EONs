## About the Project
Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) have emerged as a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing demand for high-speed, flexible, and efficient communication systems. DeepRMSA, which stands for Deep Reinforcement Learning for Routing, Modulation, and Spectrum Allocation, is a cutting-edge approach that leverages the power of deep learning to enhance the resource allocation process in EONs. This repository serves as a central hub for all the code, documentation, and resources related to my research. <br>

## Key Objectives
- Develop and implement the DeepRMSA algorithm for EONs.
- Evaluate the performance of DeepRMSA against traditional resource allocation methods.
- Provide a comprehensive set of tools and documentation for researchers and enthusiasts interested in EON optimization. <br>
